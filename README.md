# alx-low_level_programming
Introducing the basics of C programming language.

## This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to various tasks completed during my time in the ALX Software Engineering program.

## To maintain a high standard of code quality, I have utilized the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) Linter tool in this repository. *Betty* Linter is a linter for C programming that checks code for compliance with the Holberton School's style guide. This ensures that my code is easy to read, maintain and understand, making it easier for other developers to collaborate on my projects.
